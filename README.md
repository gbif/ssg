# SSG

A set of Gulp plugins, Gulp tasks, templates, client js and stylesheets to quickly create a new static site for the GBIF network
Most parts could be used separately if there is a need for larger degree of control. The idea has been to use Gulp for generating static sites. And have a shared template for doing it. This to ensure that the sites look and behaves alike and hopefully be easier to maintain.

Example of usages

* There is an example zip included.
* There is a more complex example and documentation site at https://github.com/gbif/ssg-example
