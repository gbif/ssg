	    <h1><a name="frequently-asked-questions" class="anchor" href="#frequently-asked-questions"><span class="header-link"></span></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h1></div></section><section class="block"><div class="block-content"><p>This regularly updated list of FAQs on BID calls for proposals includes responses to questions sent to <a href="mailto:bid@gbif.org">bid@gbif.org</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="on-forming-consortia-and-partnerships" class="anchor" href="#on-forming-consortia-and-partnerships"><span class="header-link"></span></a>On forming consortia and partnerships</h2><p><strong>What are the minimum and maximum number of partners in a regional consortium?</strong></p>
<p>A minimum of three partners is required in the regional consortium. These three partners must be legal entities from three different African ACP countries. There is no upper limit for the number of consortium members.</p>
<p><strong>Can private companies be involved as partners in any of the BID grants?</strong></p>
<p>The call for proposals states the following: “Applicants must be legal entities located in an African ACP country (see Annex A, Section 1). Such entities include national government agencies, GBIF Participant nodes, natural history museums and collections, research institutes, universities, and NGOs.”. In addition it states that: “All BID funded activities must be not-for-profit”.</p>
<p>All these parties, mentioned above, can be partners in a national biodiversity data mobilization grant or consortium partners in a regional biodiversity data mobilization.</p>
<p>Commercial enterprises can be part of the consortia in national and regional BID projects but are excluded from receiving funds under the BID programme. The recommendation would be for private companies to co-fund the activity, for example by covering costs of their involvement if any.</p>
<p><strong>What type of institution can lead a national biodiversity data mobilization grant?</strong></p>
<p>The guidelines for national biodiversity data mobilization grants state that: “Applications must be submitted by the project coordinator that will coordinate the project activities on behalf of the project partners. The project coordinator must be a legal entity from an African ACP country (see <a href="http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf">Annex A, Section 1</a>). The project coordinator will be responsible for managing the grant and for the project reporting”.</p>
<p>The call for proposals does not further specify the institution that should lead the ‘national biodiversity data mobilization grants’ as the project coordinator. Some of the best examples of partnerships dealing with biodiversity information management come from the GBIF network. Participation in GBIF is not a requirement for applying to the BID call for proposals. However, the GBIF Secretariat would  recommend treating the partnerships in a national grant as a national biodiversity information facility, coordinated by a  proto GBIF Participant Node.</p>
<p>Section 6.1 of the guide ‘Establishing an Effective GBIF Participant Node’ explains the selection of an institutional location for a node. The chapter includes potential advantages and disadvantages of selecting various types of host institutions, based on their mandates. The recommendation is that the same rationale be followed in choosing the coordinator for  a national grant under the BID call for proposals.</p>
<h2><a name="on-eligible-countries" class="anchor" href="#on-eligible-countries"><span class="header-link"></span></a>On eligible countries</h2><p>Can institutions and agencies based in non-ACP countries be partners in the consortium applying for BID grants?
In the case of regional biodiversity data mobilization grants, in addition to the minimum of three consortium partners from eligible African ACP countries, projects may choose to include one consortium partner that is a legal entity located EITHER in one of the eligible countries listed in section 2 of <a href="http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf">Annex A</a> OR, where other requirements are met, in one of the countries listed in <a href="http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf">Annex A</a>, section 3.</p>
<h2><a name="on-developing-project-proposals" class="anchor" href="#on-developing-project-proposals"><span class="header-link"></span></a>On developing project proposals</h2><p><strong>Can a single applicant participate in several concept notes submitted to the BID call for proposals?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, an applicant may participate in several concept notes, including developing applications for different grant types. However, the maximum total project funding that any single applicant can receive through the course of the BID programme is 60,000 Euro.  </p>
<p>In cases where applicants are considering multiple small grants, it is recommended to also explore the potential of national or regional grants. BID aims not only to increase the amount of published biodiversity information from sub-Saharan Africa, but also to develop lasting national, regional or thematic networks to support ongoing data sharing and reuse.</p>
<p>Please note that projects funded by small grants have an implementation period of up to one year, whereas national or regional projects may have activities continuing for up to two years.</p>
<p><strong>What is the expected duration of the projects?</strong></p>
<p>National biodiversity data mobilization projects and regional biodiversity data mobilization projects can run for a maximum of 2.5 years, with the final six months reserved for reporting and evaluation. Small biodiversity data mobilization projects can be implemented over a maximum of one year, with an additional six-month reporting and evaluation period.</p>
<p>Can an institution submit a proposal for gathering new data?
The BID programme focuses on mobilizing existing biodiversity data, rather than supporting new data gathering from the field. It will support the work required to mobilize the data, with emphasis on ensuring that the data are of sufficient quality to be published to the GBIF network and to enable their reuse in targeted use cases in research and decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>The eligibility criteria in the BID call for proposals states that all project partners must have completed one of the BID surveys. Can my organization take the survey now?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the survey has been extended and is still open.  Surveys may be filled out in English, French or Portuguese, and accessed through <a href="http://www.gbif.org/news/surveys-for-data-holders-decision-makers">the links in this page</a>.</p>
<p>The survey may be filled at any time before submission of the concept note.</p>
