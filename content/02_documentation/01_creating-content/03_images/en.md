# Responsive images

```styledYaml
images:
- title: portrait

You can insert normal images in markdown, but if you need larger images that scales with the device you can insert them using Yaml. This allows us to wrap then in a div and use bottom padding to control the height. The image will now keep aspect ratio as well as fit the screen. And the page won't jump if the image is loaded on a slow connection.
