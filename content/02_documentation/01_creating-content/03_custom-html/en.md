# Custom HTML

If you need to insert something more complex than what can be handled in markdown, there is the option to insert custom HTML. That of course requires knowledge about creating websites. This map is an example of customly inserted HTML.



```styledYaml
html:
- path: map-test.html
```


Inserting arbitrary html is simple. HTML should be located in the folder `inject`

```highlight
html:
- path: map-test.html
```

The best way to get an understanding of this is to look in these documentation markdown files.
