_The first call for proposals from sub-Saharan Africa for the Biodiversity Information for Development (BID) programme._

The first call for proposals from sub-Saharan Africa for the Biodiversity Information for Development (BID) programme, published in September 2015, brought in 143 initial concept notes for projects coordinated from 34 African countries.

The total amount of funds requested was in excess of six times the value of the €900,000 available for this call.

The deadline for submitting initial concept notes for the 2015 Africa call was 20 November 2015. GBIF and its evaluation panel have invited a selected number of applicants to prepare full proposals, which are due on 26 Feb 2016. Selected projects will be announced in April 2016.

GBIF will issue calls for proposals from ACP countries in the Caribbean and Pacific Islands in 2016, with a second and final call for Africa ACP countries planned in 2017.

Funded by the European Union and led by GBIF, BID is a multi-year programme to increase the availability and use of biodiversity information for research and decision-making in the ‘ACP’ nations of sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.
