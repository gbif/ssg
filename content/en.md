# Static Site Generation with Gulp

_Tools for building static sites with Gulp. This site serves as documentation and an example_

> At GBIF we would like to have the option to quickly create new small sites. This would be useful for temporary projects with a lot of content as well as focused channels for specific audiences. 

## What is this

This is an example of what a static site made with the generator can look like. You can restyle it if needed. In fact you should. The base stylesheet is intended to make the sites look similar to each other and the main site [GBIF.org](http://gbif.org). The intention hasn't been to create a full blown static site generator, but a predefined build process, templates and style that allows for consistency and simplicity. In these pages you can read more about generating a static site and how to customize it.

## Why
The first ever website was static. Then came along dynamic sites. Now static is back in vogue. [Why Static Website Generators Are The Next Big Thing](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/).
